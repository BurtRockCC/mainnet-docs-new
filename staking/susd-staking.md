### For Debt Jubilee Participants

If you are participating in the Debt Jubilee, you must stake at least **20% of your original sUSD debt** to keep your debt forgiveness active. If you fall below this threshold, your Debt Jubilee will be paused. Meeting the 20% requirement will unpause your debt burn and resume forgiveness.
