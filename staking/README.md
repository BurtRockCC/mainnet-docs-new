# SNX Staking

With the launch of [SIP-420](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-420/), Synthetix has transitioned from self-staking to delegated staking. Instead of minting sUSD by taking on debt, SNX holders can now deposit into the 420 Pool, where the protocol mints sUSD and deploys it across DeFi to generate yield on your behalf.

### Existing Stakers

All legacy staking positions have been migrated to the 420 Pool.\
→ Use [Managing Debt Jubilee and Legacy Staking](managing-debt-jubilee.md) to track, manage, or claim your position.

### New Stakers

SNX staking is now live for new stakers via the 420 Pool.\
→ Get started with [How to Stake SNX](how-to-stake-snx.md)

Staking via [**Infinex**](https://infinex.xyz/) is coming soon for a simplified experience.
