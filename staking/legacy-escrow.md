# Legacy Escrow

Legacy escrowed SNX can still be claimed and vested if you participated in previous staking programs on Ethereum or Optimism.

To claim your legacy escrowed SNX:

1. Go to [https://legacy-staking.synthetix.io/escrow](https://legacy-staking.synthetix.io/escrow)
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Switch to the network (Ethereum or Optimism) where you previously staked.
4. Vest any remaining legacy escrow tokens to your wallet.

All other legacy staking functions are now deprecated. If you are missing a legacy staking position, please [visit us in Discord](https://discord.gg/synthetix) for support.
