# Managing Orders and Positions

The lower panel of the trading interface is your hub for managing everything after placing trades. From here you can monitor open positions, adjust or cancel pending orders, review past activity, and manage the collateral backing your account. These tools give you full control over your exposure, risk, and performance in one place.

## Managing Positions

The **Positions** tab shows all of your active trades. Each row updates in real time so you can track performance and risk without leaving the trading screen.

* View key details for every position, including entry price, mark price, liquidation price, and margin ratio
* Monitor unrealized profit and loss as the market moves
* Add or remove margin to adjust exposure, or enable Auto Margin to top up automatically from your account balance
* Set or modify take-profit and stop-loss levels directly from the position row
* Close a position instantly with a Market close, place a Limit close, or use **Close All Positions** to exit everything at once

## Managing Orders

The **Orders** tab lists all pending orders that haven’t filled yet. This is where you keep track of upcoming trades and make changes before they execute.

* Review open orders with details such as market, order type, direction, trigger or limit price, and size
* Edit an order’s price or amount before it executes
* Cancel any unfilled order instantly from the order row
* Check advanced options like Reduce-Only or Post-Only to confirm execution behavior

## Viewing History

The **History** tabs record all of your past trading activity. Use them to review orders, confirm executions, and analyze performance.

* Open **Order History** to see every order you’ve placed, including those that were canceled
* Use **Trade History** to review completed trades, with details such as fill price, filled quantity, and realized PnL
* Check the **PnL view** for a complete breakdown of each position from open to close, including fees and funding costs

## Managing Collateral

The **Balances** tab shows the assets backing your account and gives you full control over deposits and withdrawals.

* Review supported margin assets, their balances, last price, and net asset value
* Check how much collateral is available to trade versus locked in active positions
* Deposit assets to increase available margin for trading
* Withdraw collateral that isn’t currently in use
