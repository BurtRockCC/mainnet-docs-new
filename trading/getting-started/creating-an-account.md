# Creating an Account

### Creating a Trading Account

After your wallet is connected and funded, click **Create Account** in the top-right corner of the interface. This sets up your **perpetual futures account**, which is controlled by your wallet.\

### Depositing Initial Margin

To create your trading account, select the amount of margin to deposit.

* Deposited margin is immediately available for trading.
* The system uses **cross-margin**: all margin in your account is shared across open positions and at risk if liquidation thresholds are reached.
* You may add more margin at any time, even with open trades, but keep in mind liquidation can occur before additional deposits are confirmed on-chain. See [depositing-margin.md](depositing-margin.md "mention")for more information on deposits.
