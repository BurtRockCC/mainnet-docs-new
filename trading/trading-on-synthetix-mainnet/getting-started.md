# Getting Started

Getting started on Synthetix Exchange is easy, and can be done in just a few clicks. Before you begin, ensure you have everything you need:

* **Margin Collateral:** You can deposit any of the supported assets on Ethereum. If you do not have assets on Ethereum yet, you can purchase them on a centralized exchange, bridge from other networks, or swap from other assets on Ethereum.
* **A Reliable Network Connection:** Perpetual Futures are a tool for active trading. Users should ensure they are able to monitor and manage positions in a 24/7 marketplace.

### Depositing Margin

To create your trading account, you will be required to make an initial margin deposit. Following you initial margin deposit, you can&#x20;

* Deposited margin is immediately available for trading.
* The system uses **cross-margin**: all margin in your account is shared across open positions and at risk if liquidation thresholds are reached.
* You may add more margin at any time, even with open trades, but keep in mind liquidation can occur before additional deposits are confirmed on-chain.&#x20;
