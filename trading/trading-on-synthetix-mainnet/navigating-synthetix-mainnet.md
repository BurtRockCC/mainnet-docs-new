# Navigating Synthetix Mainnet

The Synthetix Exchange is designed so that all the tools you need for trading, account management, and market research are a click away. Each page in the navigation provides a different view of your account or the broader market. Below is an overview of what you’ll find on each page.

#### Trading Page (Default)

When you first connect, you’ll land on the main trading page. This is where you’ll spend most of your time. From here you can:

* Place and manage orders using the order entry panel on the right.
* Track price action and use indicators with the TradingView chart.
* Monitor the order book and recent trades to see real-time liquidity.
* Switch between tabs above the chart for additional market data such as depth, funding history, or asset details.
* View your open positions, open orders, balances, and PnL in the tabs below the chart.

This page combines market data with your personal account activity so you can make trading decisions and manage risk in one place.

#### Markets Page

The Markets page gives you a sortable list of all available trading pairs on Synthetix Mainnet. You can compare key metrics across assets such as:

* Current market price
* 24h price change
* 1h funding rate
* Open interest
* 24h trading volume

Use this page when deciding which market to trade or when comparing performance across assets.

#### Portfolio Page

The Portfolio page is your account dashboard. It consolidates information about your balances, margin usage, equity, and PnL. From here you can:

* Review your current collateral and available margin.
* Monitor unrealized and realized PnL across positions.
* Check your trade and order history.
* See how much margin is in use and how much is free to allocate.

Think of this as the control center for your account—it’s where you track overall performance, not just individual trades.

#### Vaults Page

Coming soon. For more information on providing liquidity, see [LPing](https://app.gitbook.com/o/CgKKbcaDraUAYIovoOdl/s/S8u8F957sYKj8NX1DTa1/ "mention").
