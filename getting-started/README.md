# Getting Started

## What is Synthetix

Synthetix is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol built on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. It enables the creation and trading of synthetic assets, offering deep liquidity and a robust incentive system for stakers, traders, and liquidity providers. Synthetix’s modular architecture supports a wide range of DeFi products, including perpetual futures, leveraged tokens, and stablecoins, all governed by a community-driven DAO.

Key components of Synthetix include:
- **Vaults:** Where stakers deposit supported collateral types (e.g., SNX, ETH, stablecoins).
- **Pools:** Aggregate collateral and allocate it to derivative markets.
- **Markets:** Enable trading of synthetic assets and derivatives.
- **Rewards Distributors:** Distribute rewards to stakers and liquidity providers.

## Synthetix Products

Synthetix powers several core products:

- **Staking:** Stake SNX or other supported collateral to earn rewards and support the protocol’s liquidity.
- **Synthetix Exchange:** A flagship decentralized perpetuals exchange offering up to 50x leverage, deep liquidity, and advanced trading features. [Learn more](https://exchange.synthetix.io/)
- **Leveraged Tokens:** Mint and trade tokens with up to 10x leverage, without margin management or risk of liquidation. [Learn more](https://leverage.synthetix.io/)
- **Stablecoins:** sUSD and USDx are over-collateralized stablecoins used for trading and margin.
- **Liquidity Provision:** Provide liquidity to earn a share of trading fees and protocol rewards. [Liquidity App](https://liquidity.synthetix.io/)

## Tokens

### SNX

SNX is the governance and utility token of the Synthetix protocol. It is used to vote for [governance](../governance.md) council members in elections and can be [staked](../staking/how-to-stake-snx.md) to mint sUSD and earn rewards. SNX was originally issued on Ethereum and has since expanded to other networks. As of [Dec. 11, 2023](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-end-of-synthetix-token-inflation/), SNX is no longer inflationary and is subject to regular buybacks and burns.

### Stablecoins

#### sUSD (v2)

sUSD (v2) is Synthetix's over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by SNX deposits in the v2 system. It can be borrowed with 0% interest against SNX and is used as margin on Synthetix V2 deployments (e.g., Optimism). sUSD (v2) is fungible across Ethereum Mainnet and Optimism.

## Synthetix Governance

The Synthetix DAO is governed by an elected council of 7 seats as a result of [Referendum SR-2](https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetixs-bold-reboot-what-sr-2-means-for-the-future/) passed in October, 2024. Elections for all seats except the Strategy, Technical, and Ops seats are conducted every 6 months, held in the first two weeks of every October and April.

### Councilors

1. Treasury Seat: coKaiynne
2. Advisory Seat: Kain Warwick
3. Advisory Seat: Jordan Momtazi
4. Advisory Seat: MasterMojo
5. CC seat — Strategy: Fenway (Benjamin Celermajer)
6. CC seat — Operations: Cavalier
7. CC seat — Technical: Brent

### Voting

Voting power in the Synthetix governance process is exclusively determined based on staking SNX in the V2X system. Stakers who have migrated their SNX to the V3 Legacy Market on Ethereum Mainnet will continue to have voting power proportional to their staked SNX.
