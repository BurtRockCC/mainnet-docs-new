# Tokens

## SNX

SNX is the governance and utility token of the Synthetix protocol. It is used to vote for governance council members in elections and can be staked to earn SNX rewards. Staked SNX backs Synthetix products.

[SNX staking](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EzIjjJJwyP26Og6X8i0y/) is available on Ethereum Mainnet. Some legacy stakers may participate in the [Debt Jubilee](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EzIjjJJwyP26Og6X8i0y/debt-jubilee) on Optimism with their staked SNX tokens, however all new products will be available only on Ethereum Mainnet. Those with tokens on other networks who are not participating in the debt jubilee on Optimism are encouraged to bridge back to Ethereum Mainnet as we deprecate old products.

## sUSD and Stablecoins

* **sUSD** is the primary over-collateralized stablecoin of the Synthetix ecosystem. It is available on Ethereum Mainnet for staking and LPing and settling legacy Debt Jubilee positions.
