# Governance

SNX staking is now simpler than ever. Stake your SNX to secure the protocol, earn rewards, and participate in governance. Staking SNX gives you voting power in the Synthetix DAO and a share of protocol incentives.

The Synthetix DAO is governed by an elected council of 7 seats as a result of [Referendum SR-2](https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetixs-bold-reboot-what-sr-2-means-for-the-future/) passed in October, 2024. Elections for all seats except the Strategy, Technical, and Ops seats are conducted every 6 months, held in the first two weeks of every October and April.

## Councilors
1. Treasury Seat: coKaiynne
2. Advisory Seat: Kain Warwick
3. Advisory Seat: Jordan Momtazi
4. Advisory Seat: MasterMojo
5. CC seat — Strategy: Fenway (Benjamin Celermajer)
6. CC seat — Operations: Cavalier
7. CC seat — Technical: Brent

## Voting
Voting power in the Synthetix governance process is exclusively determined based on staking SNX. Stakers have voting power proportional to their staked SNX to elect four out of seven Spartan Council seats each epoch.
