# The SLP Vault

The **Synthetix Liquidity Provider (SLP) Vault** is the protocolâ€™s **community market making vault**, designed to back all perps markets on Ethereum Mainnet. By depositing **sUSD** into the vault, users become passive liquidity providers, earning a share of trading revenues and fees generated on the exchange.

#### Pre-Deposits

The **SLP pre-deposit campaign is now live.** Pre-deposits allow you to commit sUSD to the vault ahead of launch, earning Synthetix Points for your commitment.

* During pre-deposits, funds are not exposed to any active market making strategies.
* Migration to the live vault is optional once Synthetix Mainnet launches.
* Pre-depositors will be eligible for points incentives, which can later be redeemed for rewards.

To pre-deposit in the SLP Vault, visit the [Synthetix pre-deposit interface](https://predeposit.synthetix.io/).For full details on the SLP vault and how pre-deposits work, see the blog post [Be the House with SLP](https://blog.synthetix.io/be-the-house-with-slp/).
