# Providing Liquidity on Synthetix

Synthetix Mainnet is powered by a combination of market makers, stakers, and liquidity providers that ensure deep liquidity and robust backing for all trading activity.

* **SLP (Synthetix Liquidity Provider):** The community-operated **market making vault** that backs all perps markets on Synthetix Mainnet. Anyone can deposit to SLP and share in exchange revenues.
* **SNX Staking:** Both **sUSD** and the SLP vault are ultimately backed by the **SNX token**, providing the base layer of security for the system. _Learn how to stake SNX in_ [_How to Stake SNX_](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EzIjjJJwyP26Og6X8i0y/)_._
* **sUSD LPing and Incentives:** sUSD is a central asset on Synthetix Mainnet, and **incentivized LPing and deposits** are available on Ethereum Mainnet.

Together, these components form the foundation of liquidity and stability on Synthetix Mainnet.
