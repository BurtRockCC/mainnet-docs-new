## Stake sUSD and sUSDe in Curve & Deposit LP Tokens via StakeDAO: Step by Step Guide

This guide walks you through depositing sUSD and sUSDe into a Curve pool, receiving LP tokens, and then depositing those tokens into a StakeDAO strategy to earn rewards.

### Stake sUSD and sUSDe in Curve

#### Prepare Assets and Wallet

Get your stable coins ready: Ensure you have the required sUSD and/or sUSDe in your wallet, with enough ETH to cover gas fees. Both sUSD and or sUSDe can be acquired via [Curve](https://curve.fi/).&#x20;

LP incentives are only available on Ethereum Mainnet. If you have sUSD on Optimism, please see our guide on [Bridging sUSD](https://docs.synthetix.io/tokens/bridging-susd).

#### Select Assets & Amounts

Input the amount of sUSD and sUSDe you wish to deposit. Curve will show you the pool ratios and the estimated LP tokens you’ll receive.

> Note: when only sUSD is deposited some will be swapped into sUSDe non-proportionally.

Once reviewing the details, confirm the transaction in your wallet. Wait for the network to confirm the transaction to receive your LP tokens.

### Deposit Your LP Tokens into StakeDAO

Go to the [StakeDAO Yield Page](https://www.stakedao.org/yield?search=susd%20susde) and connect the same wallet holding your recently acquired sUSDUSDe LP tokens.

#### Approve & Deposit LP Tokens:

Select the strategy associated with your Curve pool. Follow the on-screen instructions for two more transactions for an approval and deposit your LP tokens into the StakeDAO strategy.

Once deposited, your LP tokens will begin earning rewards. You can monitor your yields and [claim](https://www.stakedao.org/claim) rewards.

You can claim your rewards as often as you wish or set them to auto-compound to potentially enhance your returns over time.
